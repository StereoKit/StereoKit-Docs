# Getting Started with StereoKit - Visual Studio Code

StereoKit's onboarding has generally been optimized for Visual Studio
'Prime', but VS Code definitely has some benefits, like running on
platforms other than windows! This path will be expanded on in the future,
but here's a quick way to get started on it right now.

This guide also serves as a way to get started with C# projects in a
command line environment! VS Code may have additional extensions that can
make this experience simpler.

This requires having [the .NET **SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
installed on your machine. Some development setups may already have this
installed, you can try running `dotnet --version` to double check!

To create the project:
```shell
mkdir ProjectName
cd ProjectName

dotnet new console
dotnet add package StereoKit
```

Add some code to get started:
```csharp
using StereoKit;

SK.Initialize();
SK.Run(()=>{
    Mesh.Sphere.Draw(Material.Default, Matrix.S(0.1f));
});
```

To run the project:
```shell
# For .NET's hot-reload functionality
dotnet watch

# Or just a normal run
dotnet run
```
