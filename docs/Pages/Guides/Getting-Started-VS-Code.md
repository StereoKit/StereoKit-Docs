# Getting Started with StereoKit - Visual Studio Code

The [regular getting started guide]({{site.url}}/Pages/Guides/Getting-Started.html)
and the official templates now cater to Visual Studio Code, but if you're
interested in setting up a StereoKit project for VS without using the
templates, here's a quick rundown!

![Creating a new StereoKit project in VS Code](/img/StereoKitDotnetWoah.gif)

This guide also serves as a way to get started with C# projects in a
command line environment! VS Code may have additional extensions that can
make this experience simpler.

This requires having [the .NET **SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
installed on your machine. Some development setups may already have this
installed, you can try running `dotnet --version` to double check!

To create the project:
```shell
mkdir ProjectName
cd ProjectName

dotnet new console
dotnet add package StereoKit
```

Add some code to get started:
```csharp
using StereoKit;

SK.Initialize();
SK.Run(()=>{
    Mesh.Sphere.Draw(Material.Default, Matrix.S(0.1f));
});
```

To run the project:
```shell
# For .NET's hot-reload functionality
dotnet watch

# Or just a normal run
dotnet run
```
