# Tools and Extensions

Here's a list of known tools designed to work with or extend StereoKit! If
you've got something you'd like to see listed here, please file an Issue on
the GitHub repository, we'd love to see it!

## [NuGet] - Official - [StereoKit.HolographicRemoting](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit.HolographicRemoting)

This NuGet package is an implementation of HoloLens' Holographic Remoting
for StereoKit! This is an easy way to get desktop functionality onto your
HoloLens, or cut down on iteration time while testing on-device.

## [NuGet] - Official - [StereoKit.DesktopMirror (Windows)](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit.DesktopMirror)

A small library for duplicating your desktop screen within a StereoKit
application on Windows. Useful for developing in-context!

## [GitHub] - Official (WIP) - [StereoKit Browser](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit-Browser)

This is a short StereoKit sample that shows implementing a browser UI
widget using CefSharp!

## [GitHub] - [StereoKit Tools Collection](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit/tree/master/Examples/StereoKitTest/Tools)

A small collection of `IStepper` tools and utilities for StereoKit.

## [GitHub] - [StereoKit Light Bake](https://github.com/maluoi/SKLightBake)

This is a quick demo for performantly managing static scenes, and baking
lighting into them with StereoKit! This bakes lighting into the vertex
colors of the mesh, so is visually limited by the number of vertices the
mesh has, and will merge meshes together.
