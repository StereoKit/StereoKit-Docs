description: This is a copy of the settings that StereoKit was initialized with, so you can refer back to them a little easier. Some of these values will be different than provided, as StereoKit will resolve some default values based on the platform capabilities or internal preference. These are read only, and keep in mind that some settings are only requests! Check SK.System and other properties for the current state of StereoKit.
