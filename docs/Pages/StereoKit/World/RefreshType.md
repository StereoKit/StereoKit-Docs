## Description
What information should StereoKit use to determine when
the next world data refresh happens? See the `WorldRefresh` enum
for details.


## Examples

### Configuring Quality Occlusion

If you expect the user's environment to change a lot, or you
anticipate the user's environment may not be well scanned already,
then you may wish to boost the frequency of world data updates. By
default, StereoKit is quite conservative about scanning to reduce
computation, but this can be configured using the World.RefreshX
properties as seen here.

```csharp
// If occlusion is not available, the rest of the code will have no
// effect.
if (!SK.System.worldOcclusionPresent)
	Log.Info("Occlusion not available!");

// Configure SK to update the world data as fast as possible, this
// allows occlusion to accomodate better for moving objects.
World.OcclusionEnabled = true;
World.RefreshType     = WorldRefresh.Timer; // Refresh on a timer
World.RefreshInterval = 0; // Refresh every 0 seconds
World.RefreshRadius   = 6; // Get everything in a 6m radius
```
