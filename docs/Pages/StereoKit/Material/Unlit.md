description: The default unlit material! This is used by StereoKit any time a mesh or model needs to be rendered with an unlit surface. Its shader may change based on system performance characteristics, so it can be great to copy this one when creating your own materials! Or if you want to override StereoKit's default unlit behavior, here's where you do it!

StereoKit's default unlit behavior, here's where you do it!

```csharp
matUnlit = Material.Unlit.Copy();
matUnlit[MatParamName.DiffuseTex] = Tex.FromFile("floor.png");
