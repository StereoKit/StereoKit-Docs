|string id|An id for tracking element state. MUST be unique             within current hierarchy.|
|Single& value|The value that the slider will store slider              state in.|
|float min|The minimum value the slider can set, left side              of the slider.|
|float max|The maximum value the slider can set, right              side of the slider.|
|float step|Locks the value to intervals of step. Starts              at min, and increments by step.|
|[Vec3]({{site.url}}/Pages/StereoKit/Vec3.html) topLeftCorner|This is the top left corner of the UI             element relative to the current Hierarchy.|
|[Vec2]({{site.url}}/Pages/StereoKit/Vec2.html) size|The layout size for this element in Hierarchy             space. If an axis is left as zero, it will be auto-calculated. For             X this is the remaining width of the current layout, and for Y this             is UI.LineHeight.|
|[UIConfirm]({{site.url}}/Pages/StereoKit/UIConfirm.html) confirmMethod|How should the slider be activated?             Push will be a push-button the user must press first, and pinch             will be a tab that the user must pinch and drag around.|
|RETURNS: bool|Returns true any time the value changes.|
