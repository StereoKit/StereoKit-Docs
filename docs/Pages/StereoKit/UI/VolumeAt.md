```csharp
static BtnState VolumeAt(string id, Bounds bounds, UIConfirm interactType, Handed& hand, BtnState& focusState)
```
A volume for helping to build one handed interactions.
This checks for the presence of a hand inside the bounds, and if
found, return that hand along with activation and focus
information defined by the interactType.

## Examples

This code will draw an axis at the index finger's location when
the user pinches while inside a VolumeAt.

![UI.InteractVolume]({{site.screen_url}}/InteractVolume.jpg)

```csharp
// Draw a transparent volume so the user can see this space
Vec3  volumeAt   = new Vec3(0, 0.2f, -0.4f);
float volumeSize = 0.2f;
Default.MeshCube.Draw(Default.MaterialUIBox, Matrix.TS(volumeAt, volumeSize));

BtnState volumeState = UI.VolumeAt("Volume", new Bounds(volumeAt, Vec3.One * volumeSize), UIConfirm.Pinch, out Handed hand);
if (volumeState != BtnState.Inactive)
{
	// If it just changed interaction state, make it jump in size
	float scale = volumeState.IsChanged()
		? 0.1f
		: 0.05f;
	Lines.AddAxis(Input.Hand(hand)[FingerId.Index, JointId.Tip].Pose, scale);
}
```
