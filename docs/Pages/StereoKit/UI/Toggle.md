## Examples

### A toggle button

![A window with a toggle]({{site.screen_url}}/UI/ToggleWindow.jpg)

Toggle buttons swap between true and false when you press them! The
function requires a reference to a bool variable where the toggle's
state is stored. This allows you to manage the state yourself, and
it's completely valid for you to change the toggle state separately,
the UI element will update to match.

Note that `UI.Toggle` returns true _only_ when the toggle state has
changed, and does _not_ return the current state.

```csharp
Pose windowPoseToggle = new Pose(.3f, 0, 0, Quat.Identity);
bool toggleState      = true;
void ShowWindowToggle()
{
	UI.WindowBegin("Window Toggle", ref windowPoseToggle);

	if (UI.Toggle("Toggle me!", ref toggleState))
		Log.Info("Toggle just changed.");
	if (toggleState) UI.Label("Toggled On");
	else             UI.Label("Toggled Off");

	UI.WindowEnd();
}
```
