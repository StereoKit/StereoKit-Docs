description: Red/Green/Blue/Transparency data channels, at 16 bits per-channel! This is not common, but you might encounter it with raw photos, or HDR images. The u postfix indicates that the raw color data is stored as an unsigned 16 bit integer, which is then normalized into the 0, 1 floating point range on the GPU.
