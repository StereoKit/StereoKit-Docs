title: TexFormat.R16s
description: A single channel of data, with 16 bits per-pixel! This is a good format for height maps, since it stores a fair bit of information in it. The s postfix indicates that the raw color data is stored as a signed 16 bit integer, which is then normalized into the -1, +1 floating point range on the GPU.
