description: A single channel of data, with 16 bits per-pixel! This is a good format for height maps, since it stores a fair bit of information in it. The u postfix indicates that the raw color data is stored as an unsigned 16 bit integer, which is then normalized into the 0, 1 floating point range on the GPU.
