title: MaterialParam.Color128
description: A color value described by 4 floating point values. Memory-wise this is the same as a Vector4, but in the shader this variable has a '.color' tag applied to it using StereoKits's shader info syntax, indicating it's a color value. Color values for shaders should be in linear space, not gamma.
